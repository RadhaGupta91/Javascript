             (mass in kgs and height in meter)
             1.Store  Mark's and John's mass and heigh in variables.
             2.Calculate both their BMIs
             3.Create a boolen varibale containing information about whether Mark has higher BMI than John.
             4. Print the string to the console containing the variable from step3.(Somehting like
             "Is Mark's BMI higher than Jhon's? true").

             while mike's team scored 116,94 and 123 points.
             1. Calculate  the average scroe for each team
             2. Decide which team wins in avarage(highest average score), and print the winner to the console.
             also,include the average score in the output
             3. Then change the scores to show different winners.Don't forget to take into account there might be a
             draw(the same average score)
             4.EXTRA:Mary aslo plays a basketball,and her team scoreed 97,134 and 105 points. Like before,log the average 
             winner to  the console. HINT: you will need the ** operator to take the decision.

             $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
